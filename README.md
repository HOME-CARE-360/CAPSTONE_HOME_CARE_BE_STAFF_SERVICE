# Staff service

Staff accounts and their assignments to bookings.

## How it is built

An Express service with a small TCP handler layer (`src/tcp`, `src/handlers`)
that speaks the same message-pattern contract the NestJS gateway uses, so the
gateway can call it like any other service. Messages are validated with zod
(`src/schemas`), business rules live in `src/services`, data access in
`src/repositories` through Prisma on PostgreSQL.

## Run

```bash
npm install          # runs `prisma generate` on postinstall
npm run dev
```
